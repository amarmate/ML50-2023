In this file, you can write anything relevant to the work we are doing.

## To Do List

## Objectives
__1. Handling the data:__
  - __Data Exploration:__ Describe the data and extract meaningful
insights that you consider helpful. Avoid adding visualizations and
elements that add nothing to address the problem at hand.
  - __Initial data preprocessing:__ This section covers the initial
preprocessing of your data. In essence, it should unambiguously
explain the steps and rationale behind your steps in transforming the
data into data usable by your predictive models.

__2. Predicting:__
- __Binary Classification:__ Describe your strategy for the text
classification objective. This section is separated into different
components:
  - Kaggle Performance
  - Additional Preprocessing (includes feature selection)
  - Modelling approach (model assessment (holdout, cross-validation,
etc...), algorithms used)
  - Performance assessment (choice of metrics and interpretation of
results)

- __Multiclass Classification:__ Describe your strategy for the multiclass
classification objective. This section is separated into different
components:
  - Additional Preprocessing (includes feature selection): 1v
  - Modelling approach (model assessment (holdout, cross-validation,
etc...), algorithms used): 1v
  - Performance assessment (choice of metrics and interpretation of
results): 2v
